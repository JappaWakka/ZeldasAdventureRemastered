- Way too many items (of which the practical use is often not explained very well)
- Enemies spawning in locations where they can't do anything to you or spawning right where you are when you enter the map
- Weapons that only work on a certain enemy type, resulting in like... More than 18 weapons, which are cluttering the inventory 
- I'd like to have two item slots instead of one, maybe one for attacks and one for usable items or something
- Subtitles for dialogue

- No loads
- Certain items bound to dedicated items/less menu swapping
- Shoulder button spell swapping
- Dedicated spell and attack buttons
- Certain items that you just use in location X no longer need to be equipped, instead activating if you use your wand while they're in your inventory [remastered??]
- Item pickup descriptions, hopefully helping clear up some of the more arcane puzzles
- Make boomerang actual boomerang
- Dash button w/ golden boots
- Better map, with delineation between regions and markers for NPCs, shops, and dungeon entrances
- Restoring some unused content like the lost woods aspect to the Shrine of Destiny
- Adding subtitles and additional localizations

REMASTER MODE CHANGES
- Buy items w/o equipping rupees
