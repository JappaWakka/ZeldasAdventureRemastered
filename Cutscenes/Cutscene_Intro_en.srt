00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,505
Gaspra: There'll be no
more viewing tonight.

2
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,756
Gaspra: Ah, the Scroll of Shurmak

3
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:02,485
bearer of sad news these
many years ago.

4
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:10,599
And so it was that Ganon, Lord of
Darkness, had taken over Tolemac.

5
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:15,130
He had stolen the treasured
Celestial Signs and captured Link!

6
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:20,911
A brave warrior would have to be
found to face this evil monster.

7
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:38,958
Gaspra: And so I found this
champion of strength and courage!

8
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:44,934
It is you, Princess Zelda! With this
magic pendant, go forth

9
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,320
and with each sign you gather,
so too will you gain knowledge.

10
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,716
Find your magic wand.

11
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:56,300
Use it wisely and listen to
your allies along the way!

12
00:01:56,814 --> 00:02:03,070
Go now, my Princess. Restore the
Celestial Signs and rescue Link!
