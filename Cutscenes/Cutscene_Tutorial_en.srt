00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,580
Welcome to Zelda's Adventure, an
action-adventure role-playing game.

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,053
As a player, you will adopt the
personality of our heroine Princess Zelda.

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,673
To play the game succesfully, you
must explore the great land of Tolemac.

4
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,993
To control Zelda's
movement around Tolemac...

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:26,426
...move the controller left, right,
up, down and diagonally.

6
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,293
The court astronomer Gaspra...

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:33,413
...will introduce the story of Zelda
and describe how her quest came about.

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,665
He will also reappear every time...

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,320
...Zelda has succesfully
completed an underworld shrine...

10
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,361
...and collected one of seven
treasured Celestial Signs.

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,859
Another mentor and guide
to Zelda is me... Shurmak.

12
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:52,254
Throughout the game I help
orient Zelda and guide her.

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,426
While exploring, Zelda will encounter
many enemies that inhabit this land.

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,474
She must defeat them
by using skill and speed.

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,977
Zelda attacks them with her wand.

16
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:08,230
You employ the wand by
pressing Action Button 1.

17
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:13,526
If Zelda is succesful at defeating
her enemies, she will be rewarded.

18
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:16,129
They will randomly
drop rubies and hearts...

19
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:19,843
...that will increase her currency
and life units respectively.

20
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:23,159
Rubies which are the currency of Tolemac...

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,288
...can be used to buy useful items...

22
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:28,867
...and are indicated on the
top-left corner of the screen.

23
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:34,176
Hearts are the life units that give Zelda
strength to fight throughout the game.

24
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:38,068
They are represented on the
upper-right corner of the play screen.

25
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:44,361
To select an object or a weapon on the
inventory screen, press Action Button 2.

26
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:47,365
Once in the inventory screen...

27
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,371
...you can access useful
items and weapons...

28
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:54,936
...by selecting an object with your
cursor and the pressing Action Button 1.

29
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:59,660
Treasures and weapons can be scrolled by
pressing the left window button...

30
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:03,766
...to move left, and by pressing
the right window button to move right.

31
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:09,218
The weapon in use appears in the window
in the lower right of the inventory screen.

32
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:13,584
If you select a useful item
from the treasures selection...

33
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:18,067
The item will appear in the same window
where the weapon selection appeared.

34
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:22,688
Zelda can use only one
item or weapon at a time.

35
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:27,267
In Zelda's travels she will
find many locked doors.

36
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:31,750
She must have a key in her possession
to pass through these locked entrances.

37
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:36,029
The number of keys in Zelda's possession
will appear in the small window...

38
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,968
...in the upper right of
the inventory screen.

39
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,331
To help navigate through Tolemac...

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,510
...a map is available by moving
your joystick to the map button...

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,337
...and then pressing your Action Button 1.
