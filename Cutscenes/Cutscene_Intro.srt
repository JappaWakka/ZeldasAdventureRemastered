1
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,505
There'll be no more viewing tonight.

2
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,911
*Thunder*

3
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,817
Ah, the Scroll of Shurmak...

4
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:02,448
bearer of sad news these 
many years ago.

5
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:10,599
And so it was that Ganon, Lord of
Darkness, had taken over Tolemac.

6
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:15,130
He had stolen the treasured
Celestial Signs and captured Link!

7
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:20,911
A brave warrior would have to be
found to face this evil monster.

8
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:32,057
*Magic sounds*

9
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:38,958
And so I found this champion
of strength and courage!

10
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:44,934
It is you, Princess Zelda! With this
magic pendant, go forth...

11
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,320
and with each sign you gather,
so too will you gain knowledge.

12
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,619
Find your magic wand.

13
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,228
Use it wisely and listen to
your allies along the way!

14
00:01:56,814 --> 00:02:03,075
Go now, my Princess. Restore the
Celestial Signs and rescue Link!
