///Cutscene Intro - Scroll
There'll be no more viewing tonight.

Ah, the Scroll of Shurmak...

bearer of sad news these
many years ago.

And so it was that Ganon, Lord of
Darkness, had taken over Tolemac.

He had stolen the treasured Celestial
Signs and captured Link!

///Cutscene Intro - Crystal
A brave warrior would have to be
found to face this evil monster.

And so I found this champion of
strength and courage!

///Cutscene Intro - Zelda
It is you, Princess Zelda!
With this magic pendant, go forth.

And with each sign you gather,
so too will you gain knowledge.

Find your magic wand.

Use it wisely and listen to
your allies along the way!

Go now, my Princess. Restore the
Celestial Signs and rescue Link!

///Shurmak - Introduction
I am Shurmak, your guide.

I have known you since
you were a child.

You were given a difficult challenge.

You will have to go far and
overcome great danger.

Stay calm, and use your knowledge
and strength to defeat your enemies.

Remember what you learn along
the way, and persevere.

Go now, to the one who has a
bed but never sleeps...

where by its side the red willow weeps,
and to its mouth that never speaks.

///Shurmak - Northeast of the spawn
Zelda! Zelda! Do not roam unprotected!
Look nearby for something to aid you.

///Shurmak - Southeast of the spawn
Zelda, do not be hasty! There is
something you must have nearby here.

Exploration is the key to your success.

///Glebb - Empty Pitcher
Young Princess, please attend me.

A traveler of kind intentions
has found me at last!

I am collapsed with thirst and dryness.

///Glebb - Filled Pitcher
Bless you, Princess! You have saved
the life of a weary old woman!

I offer you these treasures.
