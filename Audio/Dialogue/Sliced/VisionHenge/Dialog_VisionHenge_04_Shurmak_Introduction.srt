1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,787
Shurmak: I am Shurmak, your guide.

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:04,386
I have known you since you were a child.

3
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,473
You were given a difficult challenge.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,660
You will have to go far and overcome great danger.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,893
Stay calm and use your knowledge and strength to defeat your enemies.

6
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,368
Remember what you learn along the way, and persevere.

7
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:20,709
Go now to the one who has a bed but never sleeps...

8
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,453
where by its side the red willow weeps...

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,066
and to its mouth that never speaks.
