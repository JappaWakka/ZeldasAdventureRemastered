00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,301
Town Merchant: For thirty suns my husband and I

2
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:05,313
ran the great locksmith forge for Warbane.

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:08,899
Then Ganon came and pressed Warbane into service

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,520
for his own evil plans.

5
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,253
The forge was closed.

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,650
Warbane built a fortified retreat of his own

7
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,419
somewhere off in the Forest of Canvula to the north.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,527
We were left with nothing but these trinkets to sell!

9
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:23,747
Perhaps they will be of use to you in the underground.

10
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:26,646
I can not give them up cheap.
