00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,007
Krebb the Weary: Why spend a whole lifetime being defeated like me?

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:06,940
Get it over with quick. Go home, give up.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,207
You're patient. I can see you're not one to surrender.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,413
All right, take this dagger from me.

5
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,566
It may do you more service than it ever did me.
