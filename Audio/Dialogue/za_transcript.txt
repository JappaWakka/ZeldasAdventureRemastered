Red Knight: Hold tight, little enemy! You have something stolen from me and I am strong!
Ursore: *Roar* Who has harmed my Red Knight? I will not forget. *Roar*
Stall Keeper #3: What have we here? A princess, wandering the field of honor on her own. Come over here, and I'll sell you a ticket to the Field of the Broadsword. Watch yourself inside; the swords are heavier than you are. Twenty rubies! Get your ticket here! Just take a step through turnstile to the east and keep your head down.
Blue Knight: A thin waif like thee? Hah! Can you even lift a broadsword?
Green Knight: One as small as thee put aflight my brother!? This I must test!
Ursore: Hrm... Rrrr! Something does put my Blue Knight to shame and defeated my Green Knight! This will be punished! *Roar*
Ursore: Rar Raarrr! So, we meet at last! You are small and weak! You're no more than a bite for a warrior such as me!
Gaspra: A shout of triumph in the teeth of the impossible. You're drawing close, but your journey will carry you far to the northwest where many say there's a rumble in the earth and a glow of fire.
Goblin: Not everyone here is so ill of temper; take this as a token of welcome!
Goblin: Can't you see I'm a busy Goblin? What you seek is far away to the east. Begone!
Ryco: Ah! A customer at last! I was beginning to think I was the only person in the entire forest of Canvula! What is your fancy today?
Shurmak: Your commitment to your quest is tested here with the ruthless Warbane. Only your passion to rescue Link and save Tolemac will defeat his fiery battles.
Blacksmith: Begone! I, Blacksmith, have my work to do! No time for intruders!
Blacksmith: Feel the tip of my spears and tell me they are the finest in Tolemac!
Warbane: Further you will not go! You have not the fire in the belly to do else but obey me!
Warbane: Let no one say my welcome is not a warm one. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Do you still want my celestial sign, timid one?
Warbane: The sign is rightly my own. No slip of a girl can take it from me! Mine! Only I have the fire in my heart to keep it.
Gaspra: Zelda, life is always one order more horrifying than you expect. The great evil Ganon spoiled your victory. Make haste! Do not let him out of your sight.
Gaspra: Princess Zelda, you've succeeded! The victory has brought peace and light back to Tolemac. Your courage and strength will not be forgotten. For now, your work is done. Off you go to celebrate Link's return. But first, remember, lessons of the heart, mercy, and human kindness prevail above all else. Farewell, young princess!

//'Cut Magic Tutorial'
Shurmak: I am Shurmak... your guide. I have brought you here to teach you the uses of the magic arts. You have already learned to use a simple magic attack with your wand, but some of Ganon's terrible allies can resist this attack. They can also reply with powerful magic weapons.
Shurmak: You must learn to add new spells to your wand - these can attack some enemies that your wand is now powerless against. I will show you. Take up the Leather Book in the corner.
Shurmak: Now go into your Satchel of Possessions and add the Book to your attacking wand. Use your new spell when there is no fire.
Shurmak: You learn well, little one. There are many magic spells you can acquire for your wand. Each one increases its power based on the word, so the spells are always found in books. You will have to learn which enemies they can attack.
Shurmak: You must also learn about magic defenses. These can defend against many magic attacks. Take up the Opal Amulet you see, and add it to your possessions.
Shurmak: Your defenses against magic attack can be increased by adding magic ornaments. These will be contained in things you can wear on your body, like amulets and rings and bracelets. You will have to learn which magic attack they defend against.
Shurmak: You now have one extra spell of attack in your Leather Book, and one extra spell of defense in the Opal Amulet. Look for others in your travels, and go well. I will send you back now to where I found you, but I will be watching over you when I can... and I suppose Gaspra will be watching as well. Go well, little one, and find Link.
